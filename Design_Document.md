# Design Document

Design document for Colla - A collaboration tool for in class assignments.

Students are assigned a task, create their individual answers, and collaborate
to create the best solution for the assigned task.

#### **Contents**

This document outlines:
* Context for the project
  * Domain/Sub Domain
  * Users
    * Viewpoint User
  * Moment
* A walkthrough for how to use the site
* Design decisions made to make the site beautiful
  * Colour Scheme
  * Border Scheme
  * Font Scheme
  * Animation Effects
* Credit for the resources used

## Context

This site takes the foundation laid by assignment 2 (Group A2G004) to the next
level by building the design of the site, as well as a basic implementation of
common user tasks.

#### The Domain/Sub-domain
The domain chosen for the site is art history, and the sub-domain is early
modernist art (e.g. Piccasso)

_**((Insert some images here))**_

#### The Users
Users of this site are typically:
* Highschool aged
* Speak English (For the purposes of this assignment at least)
* May be located globally (The users in this assignment go to school in Auckland)


###### The viewpoint user
The viewpoint user is Connie Li
_**((Insert Persona here))**_

Other users of interest include Sam, the tutor, and Roger. Other students
who appear in the chat section are members of Connie's class and are not of
relevance as they do not interact with the viewpoint user in this prototype.

#### The Moment
The moment represented in this prototype is a common one. It is after the school
day, and Connie has just returned home from school. Connie's class have already
started working on their own draft solutions in class, and their homework is to
finish their submission which will be discussed in class the following day.

## Walkthrough

Connie starts by reading through her submission, followed by interacting with
the public chat. She then asks a classmate how far through the assignment they
are, and then asks the tutor about **((X))**. Following this, she edits her
assignment and submits it for review. The tutor leaves a comment, and Connie
feels confident in her answer, and therefore in her ability to participate in
the class discussion in the following day.

## Design Decisions

#### Colour Scheme
I have opted for a monochrome palette centred around a red colour: #AF3A37.

This is because monochrome palettes are typically more resistant to colourblindess problems that users may have. This is especially important given the context that Colla will be used in - the education industry. Programs in this industry should aim to be accessable to everyone to ensure that everyone as an equal opportunity when it comes to education.


#### Border Scheme
Borders (whitespace) used to section areas of the site (nav bar, chats, work)

#### Font Scheme
Fonts as a table format

#### Animation effects
Probably won't use these, but I'll leave this section here.

## Resource Credit
Bootstrap, etc
