Question and example answer taken from NZQA, NCEA art history exam, and exemplar: http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/exemplars/2017/91482-exp-2017-merit.pdf

Select ANY TWO art works from the images provided, and Select ANY TWO stylistic characteristics to answer parts (a) and (b) of the question.


This definition may help you:
Style refers to the characteristics of an art work that, when combined, distinguish the style of an artist, art movement, period, or place. These characteristics may include ways of using line, colour, tone, light, form, composition, space, scale, shape, mass, texture, ornament, and media.



Stylistic characteristics (choose TWO):
* Light
* Form
* Composition
* Space
* Ornament
* Modernist Design

Images (choose TWO):
* Henri Matisse, Le Bonheur de vivre (The Joy of Life), 1905
* Ernst Kirchner, Dancer with Raised Skirt, 1909
* Hannah Höch, Da Dandy, 1919
* Constantin Brâncuşi, Sleeping Muse, 1910
* Salvador Dalí, Swans Reflecting Elephants, 1937



Question (a):

Using supporting evidence from the art works and their contexts, explain the treatment of your two chosen stylistic characteristics in EACH of the two art works.

Question (b):
Explain the reasons for the similarities and differences between the styles of the two art works with reference to the time and place each artist was working in.


Example Answer:

The formal elements of form and composition are treated extremeley differently when comparing Henri Matisse's "Le Bonheur de vivre" (1905) with "Da Dandy" (1919) by Hanna Hoch. This is reflective of the respective stylistic movements the two artists were associated with and the artistic and social aims of both Fauvism and Dada.

The way that form has been treated in "Le Bonheur de vivre" very much embraces the curved line and movement regarding the human figures. In this work, the figures are depicted naked and their forms are voluptuous, with strong curved lines being used by Matisse, suggestive of flesh. The forms also have strong contoured outlines that place them in space, with the dark outlines often contrasting with the pastel colours of the background. Form has been treated simplistically by Matisse, as his figures are, for the most part, anatomically correct, however the flesh of the figures has been treated predominantly flat planes of colour, with no rendering to suggest musculature. Between the figures there is a great sense of movement and connection, seen especially in the linked ring of people in the centre of the work. The way matisse has treated form, demonstrates his aims as an artist, and is characteristic of the fauvist movement. This is because the fauvists wanted to evoke emotion through the use of colour, while many other formal elements are stripped back to accomplish this. In this work, Matisse wanted to create a sense of joy and simplicity with his form, through the dynamic poses of the figures and the way they inhabit the sapce in the utopian landscape.

To contrast this, form in "Da Dandy" has had completely different treatment, projecting Hochs aims as different to Matisse's. What sets apart the treatment of form in this work, is the lack of a complete human figure. Hoch has used photomontage to dismember photographs of females to create a broader form - a mans profile. There are limbs that appear connected to each other and womens faces are layed over one another. In this work, Hoch is manipulating realistic form to create another form entirely, essentially subverting the viewers perception - something synonymous with the Dada movement. Dada artists such as Hoch wanted to disect society and challenge all social norms, so by using different female body parts and creating a larger form with them, she is doing just that, through creating symbolism through the use of form.

In "Bonheur de vivre", Matisse once again utlises composition for its simplicty and to make his use of colour more impactful. The overall composition of this work is framed by the forest, which is balanced on both sides of the work and draws the viewers eye in towards the figures. This creates a triangle of composition, a traditional composition style known for creating balance and harmony. The impact of this is that the viewer is drawn to the connected ring of figures in the centre of the work, a motif that Matisse has used in his other work, most notable "The Dance"(1910). The rest of the figures are scattered throughout the foreground and midground. The way Matisse has used composition also projects the characteristics of Fauvism, regarding simplicty and harmony. This was because the Fauvists wanted their use of colour theory to be the main aspect of their work, so all the rest of the formal elements are more pulled back. Also, Matisse was concerned with the joy and emotion, so through utilising the those compositional devices to create a sense of dynamic, peaceful scenes, he is furthering his aims as an artist.



Although "Da Dandy" also has a central form that the eye is drawn to, its composition differs greatly compared to "Len Bonheur de Vivre". At first glance, the composition of this work, except for the central form appears "random" which connects to the aims of Dada, as they believed anything rational was negative and more should be left up to chance. Many different images have been cut into geometric shapes, with the words "dada" and "dandy" appearing in the top left and bottom right corners respectively. These clippings create the background , which has no sense of three dimensional space and there are no recurring shapes or patterns in the composition and it is asymetrical, unlike "Bonheur de Vivre".


In both "Le Bonheur de Vivre" by Matisse and "Da Dandy" by Hannah Hoch, the formal elements of form and composition are treated vastly differently, which demonstrates the differing aims of their respective movements. Both works, however are a reaction to "la belle peinture" and go against the features of the traditional art of the academies and salons. This is a uniting feature of all early moderist avant-garde movements, even ones with contrasting stylistic characterstics, such as Fauvisim and Dada
